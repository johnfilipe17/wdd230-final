            <h2>Our natural beauty</h2>
            <br>
            <p>  Located in Carlsbad (North County San Diego), this beach is long and open. There is a few reasons this beach is usually one of the least crowded in San Diego - The main one being that at first glance it looks impossible to get to without walking a mile due to the really steep bluffs.
                
            Little do the tourists know that just south of the end of the guardrail across from the parking lot is a trail head with a relatively steep but easy walk down the bluff onto the beach.</p>

        </div>
            <br>
            <p>Another reason it's empty is due to how you get there -there is not many houses in walking distance and the parking lot (just above the beach bluffs) can only be accessed by coming south on Carlsbad Blvd. from Canon Rd. A final reason its not that crowded? There's arguably much better surf breaks close by. That doesn't mean this spot is terrible by any means, we personally love it! But If you are looking for better waves, there are arguably much better breaks just a couple of miles away at Ponto. But if you do not mind trading off a bit of wave quality for a lot less people, this is a good choice
